# Thermal Elastohydrodynamic Program

This program was developed in order to perform simulations of rolling contacts including the effects of thermal elastohydrodynamic lubrication.

The goal of the code has been to enable converged simulations of the thermal elastohydrodynamic contacts. 
Not to make it fast nor to make the code easy to read or use. 

The author takes no responcibility for the accuracy of the code.

It has however been used to generate the data in the following publications in Tribology International:
Surface initiation of rolling contact fatigue at asperities considering slip, shear limit and thermal elastohydrodynamic lubrication
Contact fatigue initiation and tensile surface stresses at a point asperity which passes an elastohydrodynamic contact
